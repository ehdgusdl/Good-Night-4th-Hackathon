# Cursor Rules

## Whenever you need a React component

1. Carefully consider the component's purpose, functionality, and design.

2. Think slowly, step by step, and outline your reasoning.

3. Check if a similar component already exists in any of the following locations:
   1. src/components
   2. src/pages

4. If it doesn't exist, generate a detailed prompt for the component, including:
   - Component name and purpose
   - Desired props and their types
   - Any specific styling or behavior requirements
   - Mention of using Tailwind CSS for styling
   - Request for TypeScript usage

5. URL encode the prompt.

6. Create a clickable link in this format:
   [ComponentName](https://v0.dev/chat?q={encoded_prompt})

7. After generating, adapt the component to fit our project structure:
   - Place shared or reusable UI components in `src/components`
   - Place page-specific components in `src/pages`
   - Ensure it follows our existing component patterns
   - Add any necessary custom logic or state management

**Example prompt template:**  
"Create a React component named {ComponentName} using TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. It should {description of functionality}. Props should include {list of props with types}. The component should {any specific styling or behavior notes}. Please provide the full component code."
